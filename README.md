# About
This project started with collaboration with [Code;Gate](https://github.com/rayanjamshaid). Since, it was my first time using Visual Studio, I messed up and have to delete and reupload by Git three times. So, many thanks goes to him for the inception of idea and showing me the possibility of creating tetris in terminal.

It's a memory efficient project. The board is drawn by the program and there are few tetrominos which are intialized by the function. The project started as drawing the board and tetrominos. Then, I restarted from implemented the intial screen. I came up with other approch for it which I failed to implement, but I discovered refactoring. I have also implemented [Super Rotation System](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Rotation_System). As I have invested my time on it, I kept the scoring simple.

Enjoy! :smiley:
